    | model:    The Eloquent user model. Three modes are supported:
    |           - your own model using the JayI\Roster\Concerns\HasRoster trait
    |           - your own model without the trait (Roster registers the
    |             `rosterProfile` relation on it dynamically)
    |           - JayI\Roster\Models\User, for apps without a users table of
    |             their own; publish its migration with the
    |             `roster-users-migration` tag
    | key_type: The user model's primary key type - `int`, `ulid` or `uuid`.
    |           It decides the `user_id` column on roster_profiles, so set it
    |           before running the migrations.
    | columns:  Where the user's name, email and password live on the model,
    |           for schemas that use different column names. Set `name` to
    |           null if the users table has no name column.
    |
    | registration_status:
    |           `active`, or `pending` to make people who sign up through the
    |           app's own registration (Laravel's Registered event) wait for
    |           an approver. Admins choose per user when they create one, and
    |           each organization chooses for accounts its SSO or SCIM
    |           creates (its `provisioned_status`).
    | approvals.notify_approvers:
    |           Email everyone holding `roster.users.approve` when someone is
    |           waiting for approval.
    | approvals.notify_user:
