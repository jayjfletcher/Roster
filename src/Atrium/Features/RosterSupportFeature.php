/**
 * Switches Roster in Atrium on and off: its navigation, widgets, search and
 * pages. On until its global value is set. The `SupportFeature` suffix
 * matches PennantPlus's default `gate.global_only` pattern, so only the
 * global value counts and per-user access stays with Roster's permissions.
 *
 * Needs jayi/pennantplus. Point `roster.atrium.features` at a subclass to
 * change the default, or at your own feature instead.
 *
 * Pennant stores a class-based feature under its class name. The class moved
 * from `JayI\Roster\Features`, so it keeps that name for its stored values;
 * a subclass is stored under its own class name, as before.
